## Overview

ACode is a custom cross-platform code editor built on **Tauri 2**. The app is split into two layers that communicate via Tauri's IPC bridge:

- **Backend** (`src-tauri/`) — Rust. Handles all system operations: file I/O, spawning language server processes, AI integration, OS-level APIs.
- **Frontend** (`src/`) — TypeScript + React + Vite. Handles all UI: editor, panels, tabs, settings.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| App shell | Tauri 2 | Native webview (no bundled Chromium), ~10–20 MB binary, cross-platform |
| Frontend framework | React 19 + TypeScript | Familiar, large ecosystem, contributor-friendly |
| Bundler | Vite | Fast HMR, simple config |
| Editor component | CodeMirror 6 | Fully modular plugin system, first-class keybinding/command API |
| State management | Zustand | Minimal boilerplate, scales for editor state |
| AI integration | Claude Code SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) | Uses existing Claude Code subscription, no separate API billing |
| LSP client | Rust (in `src-tauri/`) | Spawns language server processes via stdio, exposes results to frontend via Tauri events |

## IPC Pattern

Tauri IPC works in two directions:

- **Frontend → Backend**: `invoke("command_name", { args })` calls a `#[tauri::command]` fn in Rust.
- **Backend → Frontend**: Rust emits events via `app.emit(...)` which the frontend listens to with `listen("event_name", handler)`.

Example flow for opening a file:
1. Frontend calls `invoke("read_file", { path })`
2. Rust reads the file from disk, returns content as a string
3. Frontend receives the content and opens it in a new editor tab

---

## AI Integration

AI features use the **Claude Code SDK** rather than the raw Anthropic API. This lets the editor piggyback on the user's existing Claude Code subscription.

The SDK runs as a subprocess managed from Rust, with streaming output forwarded to the frontend via Tauri events. See `docs/features/ai-integration.md` (TBD) for details.

---

## Language Server Protocol (LSP)

LSP client logic lives entirely in Rust (`src-tauri/src/lsp/`):

1. Rust spawns a language server process for the active file's language
2. Communicates via JSON-RPC over stdio
3. Diagnostics, completions, and hover info are forwarded to the frontend as Tauri events
4. The frontend's CodeMirror instance renders them via `@codemirror/lint` and `@codemirror/autocomplete`
